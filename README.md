Password generator that prompts for user's conditional inputs of the password after clicking on the button.
If the length of the password is not between 8 and 128, it will prompt again. 
If none of the conditions are accepted (lower case, upper case, numbers, special symbols), it will prompt for the user to accept at least one.
